## Usage

The cheat is composed out of two parts: **the loader (oxware.exe)** and **the cheat module (cheater.dll)**. By using the loader you can inject the cheat module to the game. After injecting the cheat, you can use <kbd>INSERT</kbd> key to open up the menu`. 

Both the cheat and loader have developer consoles built inside of them that you can access at any time. (inside the cheat it is the <kbd>~</kbd> key, below the escape key)

## The loader

# Support on other operating systems

This cheat is currently only available on `Windows 10 and newer`.

While making this cheat cross-platform (e.g. porting to Linux or OSX) isn't completely impossible, it would take a lot of effort, because from the beginning I designed this cheat mainly for Windows. But that being said, it isn't impossible to port.

# Support on non-steam and older versions of the game

This cheat currently supports following builds:

- `8684 steam version`
- `4554 non-steam version`
- `3266 non-steam version`
- xguard, gsclient or other custom implementations **aren't supported**.

## Uninstalling

Inside the cheat folder you can find a script called `uninstall.bat` that will uninstall all of the things that the cheat currently store on your computer. This **ins't a virus!** So feel free using it. After you run the script, you can delete the cheat folder.

However, if you still don't believe me that I have put a virus to a cheat with public source code üòÅ, you can still uninstall all of the things manually ü§î (actually, as of now - June 2023, there are only **two** things that the cheat stores on your machine).

- Delete the program (oxware.exe with other DLLs)
- Go to your appdata folder and then into folder "**Roaming**" (if you don't know how to get there, search the internet on how to get there). Then find folder called **oxware** and delete it.
- Then delete the registry data that the cheat left behind:
	- Go to registry editor (again, if you don't know how, google it)
	- And go to "**HKEY_CURRENT_USER -> SOFTWARE -> oxware**" and delete the entry.

## Anti-cheats

The cheat wasn't tested on any anticheats so far. It may or may not be detected. **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**!

### VAC

As far as I know, the CS 1.6 VAC is not so smart, so **YOU SHOULD NOT GET VAC BANNED BY USING THIS**, but having said that, **USE STILL AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

### Wargods

There have been reports with WG already detecting this cheat. In order to not get detected by WG scan even when you "removed" the cheat, you need to run the uninstall script. More on that in here: [uninstalling](#uninstalling).

## Building

This cheat is currently only available to be built inside the **Visual Studio** environment, any other building software haven't been tested or added yet.

In order to build, you will need **Visual Studio 2022** with **C++20 support**, and **v143 toolset**.

There are three main build configurations:

- **debug**: for debugging and development.

- **release**: for testing retail-like circumstances without the debug overhead.

- **retail**: for final deployment only.

In order to fully build everything, all you need to do is just hit **ctrl + shift + b** or navigate to the solution and select **Rebuild Solution**. New **build\\** directory will be created and all of the executables will be placed here.

**Also see building.md in the root directory of this repo!**
